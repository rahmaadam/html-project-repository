    <h1>Characteristics Of Big Data</h1>

<span style="color: blue"><b>Big data</b></span> can be described by the following characteristics:
<ol>
  <i><b><li>Volume</li></b></i>
The name Big Data itself is related to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays a very<br>
crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular data can actually be <br>
considered as a Big Data or not, is dependent upon the volume of data. Hence, <b>'Volume'</b> is <br>
one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with Big Data.<br><br>
  <i><b><li>Variety</li></b></i>
Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured.<br>
During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most of <br>
the applications. Nowadays, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs,<br>
audio, etc. are also being considered in the analysis applications. This variety of unstructured <br>
data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analyzing data.<br><br>
  <i><b><li>Velocity</li></b></i>
The term <b>'velocity'</b> refers to the speed of generation of data. How fast the data is generated <br>
and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data.<br>
Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, <br>
application logs, networks, and social media sites, sensors, Mobile devices, etc. The flow of data <br>
is massive and continuous.<br><br>
  <i><b><li>Variability</li></b></i>
This refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus hampering the process <br>
of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
